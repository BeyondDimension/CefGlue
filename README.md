# CefGlue
.NET binding for The Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF). 

CefGlue lets you embed Chromium in .NET apps. It is a .NET wrapper control around the Chromium Embedded Framework ([CEF](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/src/master/)). 
It can be used from C# or any other CLR language and provides both Avalonia and WPF web browser control implementations.
The Avalonia implementation runs on Windows and macOS. Linux is not supported yet.

## Releases
Stable binaries are released on NuGet, and contain everything you need to embed Chromium in your .NET/CLR application. 

## Documentation 
See the [Avalonia sample](CefGlue.Demo.Avalonia) or [WPF sample](CefGlue.Demo.WPF) projects for example web browsers built with CefGlue. They demo some of the available features.
